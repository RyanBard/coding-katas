This is a simple implementation of Tetris written with HTML5 canvas.  It is mostly just practicing implementing velocity + framerate, drawing very simple objects (rectangles), transforming matrices to rotate pieces, and simple collision detection.  The user controls are driven by the keyboard (pressing the keys faster moves the piece faster).
