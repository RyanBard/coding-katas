# A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe

[Play Tic-Tac-Toe](https://ryanbard.github.io/coding-katas/javascript/games/tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.html)

TODO

* turn based (simple, no game loop, how does this affect how you code requestAnimationFrame? do you need it?)
* maybe focus on ai?
* maybe just crank it out faster (skip coding an AI -- will make winning/losing more painful: always a draw)?
* maybe make 2 player mode?
* maybe make 0 player mode like War Games?
