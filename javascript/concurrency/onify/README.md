# Asyncify

[Run Tests](https://ryanbard.github.io/coding-katas/javascript/concurrency/onify/onify.html)

This will make a callback only run once to protect from the situation where 3rd party code might accidentally call your callback more than once.  Inspired by [Kyle Simpson's Onify](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch2.md).

# TODO

* convert debugging to unit tests
* clean up code
