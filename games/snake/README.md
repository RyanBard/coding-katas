This is a simple implementation of Snake written with HTML5 canvas.  It is mostly just practicing implementing velocity + framerate, drawing very simple objects (rectangles), and simple collision detection.  The user controls are driven by the keyboard, however, only the last valid keypress is stored and affects where the snake moves (the snake simply moves with the game loop  -- pressing keys doesn't make the snake move any faster).
