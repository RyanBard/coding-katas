This is a very simple Pong written with HTML5 canvas.  It is mostly just practicing implementing velocity + framerate, drawing very simple objects (rectangles), and simple collision detection.  The user controls are driven by the mouse cursor independant of the game loop (you can move the paddle as fast as you can move the mouse).
