This is an implementation of a [Gate](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch1.md).  A Gate is used to wait for all async operations.  It is similar to an ES6 Promise's [all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) function.
