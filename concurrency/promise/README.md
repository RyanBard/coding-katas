# An implementation of ES6-like Promises

[Run Tests](promise.html)

This is an implementation of an ES6-like [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) written in ES5 javascript.  I did this mostly just for general coding practice, to better understand how you could implement promises, and possibly to better understand how they work.

## TODO

* finish success/error chains test cases
* finish implementing promises waiting on other promises
* implement MyPromise.resolve() & MyPromise.reject()
