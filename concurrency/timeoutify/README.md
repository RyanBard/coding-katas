# Asyncify

[Run Tests](https://ryanbard.github.io/coding-katas/javascript/concurrency/timeoutify/timeoutify.html)

This will make a callback error if it isn't called within the specified amount of time.  Inspired by [Kyle Simpson's Timeoutify](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch2.md).

# TODO

* convert debugging to unit tests
* clean up code
* can't remember where I left off, so make sure the interaction of things makes sense (callbacks for both success and error: no depending on return values in 1 case and callbacks in the other)
