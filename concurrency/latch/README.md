# An implementation of a Latch

[Run Tests](latch.html)

This is an implementation of a [Latch](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch1.md).  A Latch is used to wait for the first async operation to win.  It is similar to an ES6 Promise's [race](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race) function.
